The main goal first semester was to get some hardware and make a working prototype of what our end goal was. 

Our end goal was to have an arduino with WiFi capabilities connected with some kind of temperature reading sensor that can send a notification 
(text message) to someone that needs to be notified. 

Once we had this hardware together the software side of things was to monitor the temperature being read, waiting for it to get out of range.

For the showcase we selected 100 degrees to be out of range. 

Once this limit was reached the arduino would then attempt to connect to WiFi.

After it connected we began communicating to an smtp session. 

From here we have a gmail account waiting. 

In the code you can see the address of the account.

Also from the code you can automatically send an email or in our case a text message. 

Using "phone-number"@"recipient-carrier".com you can send a text message to any phone using a gmail account. 

This completed our goal for the first semester. 

We can successfully monitor temperature and send a notification once the temperature become out of range.
